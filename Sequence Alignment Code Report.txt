Sequence Alignment Code Report

This Java code aligns gene sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm. Let's break it down:

Main Method:

The main method sets up gene sequences (x and y) and a scoring matrix, then finds and prints the highest-scoring alignment.

findAlignment Method:

This method performs dynamic programming to find the optimal alignment. It initializes a scoring array, computes scores, and traces back to construct aligned sequences.

charToIndex Method:

This method maps nucleotide characters to indices (0 to 4) for efficient scoring matrix access.

The code performs efficient gene sequence alignment, revealing the closeness of two gene sequences. It employs dynamic programming and a mapping function for nucleotide characters.
